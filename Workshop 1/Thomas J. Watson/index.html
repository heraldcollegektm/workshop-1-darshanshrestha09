    <h1> Thomas John Watson </h1> 
    Thomas John Watson Sr. (February 17, 1874 â€“ June 19, 1956) was an American businessman 
    who served as the chairman and CEO of IBM.
    [1][2] He oversaw the company's growth into an international force from 1914 to 1956.
     Watson developed IBM's management style and corporate culture from John Henry Patterson's
      training at NCR.[3]
      He turned the company into a highly effective selling organization,
       based largely on punched card tabulating machines.
       A leading self-made industrialist,[4] 
    he was one of the richest men of his time and was called the world's greatest salesman 
    when he died in 1956.</body>
